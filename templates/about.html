            <h3>// The Creator</h3>
            <p>
                This project was architected by <strong>Nunna Dhruvith</strong>, a developer deeply passionate about 
                bridging the gap between the present and the future through code. With a focus on 
                secure backend systems and intuitive design, Dhruvith built this platform to ensure 
                no memory is ever truly lost to time.

            <h3>// The Mission</h3>
            <p>
                The Time Capsule is a trusted vault designed to preserve your most precious digital moments. 
                Whether it's a message to a future self or a legacy left for a loved one, this system 
                guarantees delivery. It is more than just a scheduler; it is a promise that your voice 
                will be heard across time.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h3>// Security Guarantee</h3>
            <p>
                We prioritize data sovereignty. All capsules are digitally locked until their precise 
                activation moment. We guarantee that your data remains private, encrypted, and accessible 
                only to the designated recipient at the exact time you choose—down to the minute.
